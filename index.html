    <div class="text">GENERAL INFORMATION One of the oldest nations of the world, Ethiopia is an extraordinary country situated in the East of Africa (so-called the “Horn of Africa”). Its history spans across hundreds of years with archaeological findings dating back to more than 3 million years (such as Lucy, the oldest human ancestor ever discovered – put a link). Never fully colonized (though Italy made an attempt), the country has kept many of its cultural traditions, including its ceremonial ritual for making and drinking coffee (which was first discovered in an Ethiopian province). As of 2018, the population is approximately 102.4M and the country’s official language is “Amharic”. Orthodox Christianity is the dominant religion, with Islam coming at a close second. Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa means “New Flower” in Amharic, and inhabits only around 4.6M people. The majority of Ethiopians (some 80%) live in rural areas relying either on subsistence farming or on income from agricultural work. The steady climate makes it possible to visit throughout the year North South Cooler than the South, elevation is 2000 meters above sea level ~20*C (68 F) during the day Rainy season: between June and September Can get up to 30*C (86 F) during the day Southern region (Omo valley), rainy season is April through May.

Addis Ababa – capital  Population 3,5M  Name means “new flower” in Amharic  Viewed as Africa’s diplomatic capital, serving as the headquarters of the international African Union and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa 2. Awasa  Capital of southern region, popular honeymoon destination for Ethiopians. 3. Axum  The city contains a rich collection of historical and sacred religious monuments. Among them are the Ruins of Queen Sheba’s palace, a collection of Ethiopian churches claiming to house the Ark of the Covenant (which can only be seen by the monk who guards it), and the “Stele” – obelisks that stand as markers for the underground tombs of ancient Ethiopian royalty. 4. Bahir Dar  The capital city of the Amhara region, sitting on the south shore of Lake Tana – the source for the Blue Niles Falls. The islands and peninsulas of Lake Tana house over 20 monastic churches, some of which can be visited through guided tours. 5. Erta Ale  Translates to “smoking mountain” in the Afar language.  Erta Ale is arguably the most alluring and physically challenging attractions in Ethiopia. At its summit exists the world’s longest existing lava lake, present since the early years of the twentieth century. 6. Danakil Depression  The Danakil Depression has some of the most fascinating landscapes in the world with eye-catching colors and Sulphur springs formed by volcanic activity. The region is also home to the mythical Lake Giulietti (aka Lake Afrera), a salt water lake located 100 meters below sea level. Salt mines can be found all around the lake, where the Afar people break the salt from the ground into rectangular blocks, later selling it as an appetite inducer for cattle. 7. Lalibela - Rock Churches  One of the holiest places of Ethiopian Christianity and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the rock hewn churches of the Lalibela attract thousands of tourists every year and are a must-see when visiting the country. 8. Gondar  Best known for its 17th century castles and palaces, Gondar was founded in 1635 by Emperor Fasilidas and served as the imperial capital for 250 years. 9. Key Afer  This village contains the most beautiful market in Omo Valley, where tribes (such as the Hamer and Benna) sell their goods and commodities. The colorful market shows the diverse culture and social dynamics between the people in this part of Ethiopia. 10. Omo National Park and Omo Valley  The Southern region of Ethiopia is home to several indigenous tribes whose cultures have been cultivated over years, far away from civilization and almost completely isolated from the outside world (see the “Tribes” section below). The National Park is one of Ethiopia’s prolific nature sanctuaries, though not easily reached. 11. National Park of Semien Mountains  The jagged panorama and deep valleys lend spectacular views to these mountains, home to many of the endemic animal species of Ethiopia including the Gelada Baboon, the rare Walia Ibex and Ethiopian Wolf. OMO VALLEY TRIBES The lower Omo Valley is quite different from any other region in Ethiopia, even Africa as a whole. It is home to a remarkable mix of small, unique ethnic groups that have developed their own cultures over decades while being isolated from the outside world. Among them are the Hamer, Mursi, Dorze and Karo - all tribes that can be visited with our guides as part of an unforgettable adventure to their remote lands. Click below to learn more about the tribes. 1. Hamer Tribe Known for their fashionable adornments and colorful beads, the Hamer tribe is a strongly bonded pastoralist cohort. Hamer boys must go through the “Bull Jumping Ceremony” which commences their transition into manhood, requiring them to leap multiple times over a long line of cattle. All female relatives of the boy are whipped during the event as a sign of support for their kinsmen, earning them the right to demand his help in time of need. 2. Dorze Tribe The people of the Dorze tribe are settled in the Gamo highlands above the city Arba Minch. They are known for their huge bamboo huts that resemble the shape of an elephant’s head, as well as their expertise in fine cotton weaving. 3. Mursi Tribe This tribe is most known for their women’s custom of wearing circular clay/wooden plates in the lower lip and earlobes. The girl’s lip is pierced from around age 15, and the size of her plate is often correlated with the size of her bridewealth. It is also among the more aggressive tribes, where single men participate in ceremonial dueling called “Donga” – fighting each other with wooden poles until defeat to prove their worth as husbands to unmarried women. 4. Karo Tribe The Karo are a small tribe that distinguishes themselves from the neighboring tribes with their ornate body art. They incorporate rich, cultural symbolism into their rituals through body and face painting, intricate headdresses, and body scarification that signify status, beauty and bravery.
