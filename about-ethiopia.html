            One of the oldest nations of the world, Ethiopia is an extraordinary country situated in the East of Africa (so-called the “Horn of Africa”). Its history spans across hundreds of years with archaeological findings dating back to more than 3 million years (such as Lucy, the oldest human ancestor ever discovered – put a link). Never fully colonized (though Italy made an attempt), the country has kept many of its cultural traditions, including its ceremonial ritual for making and drinking coffee (which was first discovered in an Ethiopian province).
            <br />
            <br />
            As of 2018, the population is approximately 102.4M and the country’s official language is “Amharic”. Orthodox Christianity is the dominant religion, with Islam coming at a close second. Ethiopia’s capital Addis Ababa means “New Flower” in Amharic, and inhabits only around 4.6M people. The majority of Ethiopians (some 80%) live in rural areas relying either on subsistence farming or on income from agricultural work.

The region is also home to the mythical Lake Giulietti (aka Lake Afrera), a salt water lake located 100 meters below sea level. Salt mines can be found all around the lake, where the Afar people break the salt from the ground into rectangular blocks, later selling it as an appetite inducer for cattle.

            The lower Omo Valley is quite different from any other region in Ethiopia, even Africa as a whole. It is home to a remarkable mix of small, unique ethnic groups that have developed their own cultures over decades while being isolated from the outside world. Among them are the Hamer, Mursi, Dorze and Karo - all tribes that can be visited with our guides as part of an unforgettable adventure to their remote lands.

Hamer boys must go through the “Bull Jumping Ceremony” which commences their transition into manhood, requiring them to leap multiple times over a long line of cattle. All female relatives of the boy are whipped during the event as a sign of support for their kinsmen, earning them the right to demand his help in time of need.

The girl’s lip is pierced from around age 15, and the size of her plate is often correlated with the size of her bridewealth. It is also among the more aggressive tribes, where single men participate in ceremonial dueling called “Donga” – fighting each other with wooden poles until defeat to prove their worth as husbands to unmarried women.

            <h2 class="align-left">Cuisine</h2>
            Ethiopian cuisine is primarily made up of spicily conditioned vegetables and meat dishes. Lamb, beef, and poultry are common while pork is nonexistent as it is forbidden by the religious beliefs of Ethiopian Christians and Muslims. Christian Ethiopians fast on Wednesdays and Fridays, eating only vegetarian menu items. This is, in part, why there is an abundance of vegetarian and vegan dishes across the country. Ethiopians eat almost exclusively with their right hand, collecting ingredients with a torn-off piece of Injera (see below). It is also common for groups to eat together from the same large plate, often feeding one another.
            <br />
            <br />
            Western food is available in several destinations, with Italian dishes (such as pasta and pizza) being the most prevalent. Fresh fruit is easily accessible by the many vendors selling recently picked produce along the main roads. In most cases, all food-preferences and allergies are accommodated. Please reach out to us with any special cases.
