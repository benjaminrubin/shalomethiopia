            <h2 class="align-left">Message From the Founder</h2> My name is Andualem, and I created Shalom Ethiopia Tours to build a community centered around love and family. I hope to welcome guests into my home country and connect them with Ethiopia’s rich and diverse culture while building long lasting friendships. Shalom is the Hebrew word for peace and welfare, qualities I wish to cultivate between the locals and visitors that join me on my adventures throughout the land.
            I look forward to welcoming you to Ethiopia!
            Shalom and love,
            Andy

            <h2 class="align-left">Overview</h2>
            All tours are tailor-made, planned based on the duration of your trip and desired destinations. Most scheduled trips are between 5 and 30 days, and span across one to multiple regions of Ethiopia. For example, you may book a 7 day trip only to Omo Valley to see the tribes. Alternatively, you can book a 2 week trip covering the North, South and Omo Valley.
            High season is during the Western holidays, between mid-December to end of February. The rest of the year is considerably less busier and allows for flexibility in lodging.
            The cost of the trip covers the following expenses:
            <ul>
                <li>Transportation and fuel</li>
                <li>Domestic flights (when needed)</li>
                <li>Hotel / Lodging</li>
                <li>3 fresh meals per day</li>
                <li>Unlimited supply of bottled mineral water</li>
                <li>Entry fees for every village and site</li>
                <li>Local guide fees (required at each village)</li>
                <li>Picture fees in special areas (such as the Omo Valley tribes)</li>
            </ul>
            *Costs do not include tips for main guides and site guides.<br />
